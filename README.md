# Logistic_Regression_Model

**About the Project**
<br>
    This Logistic Regression Algorithm was one of the projects completed during my course with Internshala on Machine Learning using Python. This project uses actual data gathered and uses it to analyse whether the customers of a certain bank will churn or not based on multiple parameters.

**About the Machine Learning Model**
<br>
    In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical. For example, To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0), whether the tumour is malignant (1) or not (0), etc. Linear regression is unbounded, and this brings logistic regression into picture. Their value strictly ranges from 0 to 1.
